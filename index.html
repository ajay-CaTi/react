<!-- IMPORTANT:- Recat can WORK independently in a small portion of app even in neavbar only or in other some stuff -->

<!-- React :- is just piece javascript code , some piece of js code .
    IT JUST GIVE SOME HELPER METHODS THAT NEEDS TO DEVELOP FASTER APPLICATION -->

<!-- CAN WORK IN EXISTING APP -->
<!-- ORDER OF FILES ATTACHED IS MATTERS -->

<!-- Framework :- comes all load of thngs  -->

<!-- NPM:- PACKAGE MANAGEr npm is everything but not node package manager -->

<!-- when a basic react app created it already have npm inside it   -->

<!-- The crossorigin attribute, valid on the <audio>, <img>, <link>, <script>, and <video> elements, provides support for CORS, defining how the element handles cross-origin requests, thereby enabling the configuration of the CORS requests for the element's fetched data. Depending on the element, the attribute can be a CORS settings attribute.

The crossorigin content attribute on media elements is a CORS settings attribute. -->

<!-- package.json is a CONFIGURATION FOR NPM -->
<!-- create-react-app uses webpack and bable behind the scenes -->

<!-- parcel to bundler our app  -->

<!-- two type of dependicies we install 
1. Dev for development
2. Normal for production -->

<!-- CAReT   PARCEL -->
<!-- caret [automatically install MINOR version of that package like 2.9.3 to 2.9.6 ] -->
<!-- CARET is alwayas SAFER  -->
<!-- tilde -->
<!-- Tilde (~) notation: It is used to match the most recent patch version. [automatically install MAJOR version of that package like 2.9.3 to 3.0.0 ]-->

<!-- package-lock.json 
  configuraton for npm
  keep track version of that package install in system  -->

<!-- package-lock.json 
  integrity:-keep hash what version is installed in my machine is same deployed in production -->

<!-- node_modules folder contain all the code that fetch from npm
Act like DB contain actual data of that dependency that our app needs 
collection of dependencies-->

<!-- parcel as a project has its own dependencies known as TRANSITIVE DPENDENCIES -->

<!-- package.json keep approx version of package -->

<!-- npm
npm init
package.json
dev dependency
parcel
caret and tilde 
package-lock.json -->

<!-- npx execute the package -->
